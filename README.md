# Canvas-LS-Extension
This is my project to create a chrome extension that will combine the learning suite and canvas calendars. It's bugged me for a long time that I can't view all my assignments and due dates at the same time on one calendar since some professors use Canvas and others use learning suite. So for this project I will try to remedy that by creating a chrome extension.

My ERD will be rather simple


Since this will be a chrome extension it will be a rather simple system design, I'll use the chrome extension framework. For the scraping, background logic and UI I'll use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, maybe some web scraping program or extension that I haven't decided on. I honestly could store my data from this in the builtin/local storage but I could also hook it up to a separate db like PostgreSQL using node or something to create a backend.
